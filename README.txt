Neighborhood Mapper V.1.1.0 by Joseph Anda

NEW NOTES TO GRADER:

Insightful commentary (thank you).  

NOTABLE CHANGES:

--Results can be filtered without an AJAX request (hit 'enter' rather than clicking 'search')
--Info windows now feature more information, which is altered via the AJAX requests themselves 
--The opening of an info window is bundled in a separate function 
--Clicking list entries open associated markers 
--Markers feature animation 

USING THE MAPPER:

1)  Search a type of venue by entering it into the search bar (e.g., 'coffee shops') and clicking the 'search' button.
2)  View ,filter, and explore results in the list by checking and unchecking category boxes, or clicking on names in the list
3)  Clcick the names to pull up Wiki info (if available), and click on the Wiki info to get more info (additional info from new york times)
4)  Search new venues by entering another query into the search bar.  Only entries matching checked categories will populate


ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD MAPPER

This project is intended to showcase a few major front-end development-related skills:

1)  Using organizational libraries (in this case, knockout and jQuery)
2)  Applying the MVVM paradigm for separation of concerns
3)  Utilizing AJAX reqeusts to relay third-party info to the user
